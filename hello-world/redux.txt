Redux is available as a package on NPM for use with a module bundler or in a Node application:
npm install --save redux

The whole state of your app is stored in an object tree inside a single store.
The only way to change the state tree is to emit an action, an object describing what happened.
To specify how the actions transform the state tree, you write pure reducers.
That's it!

Here are some suggestions on when it makes sense to use Redux:
You have reasonable amounts of data changing over time
You need a single source of truth for your state
You find that keeping all your state in a top-level component is no longer sufficient



for the need the React bindings:
npm install react-redux
