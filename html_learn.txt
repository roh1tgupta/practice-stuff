The alt attribute specifies an alternative text to be used, if an image cannot be displayed.
The value of the alt attribute can be read by screen readers.

The language of the document can be declared in the <html> tag.
The language is declared with the lang attribute.
Declaring a language is important for accessibility applications (screen readers) and search engines:
<html lang="en-US">
The first two letters specify the language (en). If there is a dialect, add two more letters (US)

The HTML5 standard does not require lowercase attribute names.
The title attribute can be written with uppercase or lowercase like title or TITLE.
W3C recommends lowercase in HTML, and demands lowercase for stricter document types like XHTML.


Search engines use the headings to index the structure and content of your web pages.
Use HTML headings for headings only. Don't use headings to make text BIG or bold.

Metadata typically define the document title, character set, styles, scripts, and other meta information

Browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a paragraph.

Dropping the end tag can produce unexpected results or errors.

Browsers display <strong> as <b>, and <em> as <i>. However, there is a difference in the meaning of
these tags: <b> and <i> defines bold and italic text, but <strong> and <em> means that the text is "important".

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.
CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.

CSS can be added to HTML elements in 3 ways:
Inline - by using the style attribute in HTML elements
Internal - by using a <style> element in the <head> section
External - by using an external CSS file....<head><link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"></head>

A link does not have to be text. It can be an image or any other HTML element.

<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/">Visit our HTML tutorial</a>
Without a forward slash at the end of subfolder addresses, you might generate two requests to the server.
Many servers will automatically add a forward slash to the end of the address, and then create a new request.

A local link (link to the same web site) is specified with a relative URL (without https://www....).
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">Visit W3Schools!</a> The target attribute can have one of the following values:
_blank - Opens the linked document in a new window or tab
_self - Opens the linked document in the same window/tab as it was clicked (this is default)
_parent - Opens the linked document in the parent frame
_top - Opens the linked document in the full body of the window
framename - Opens the linked document in a named frame

HTML Links - Create a Bookmark: First, create a bookmark with the id attribute: <h2 id="C4">Chapter 4</h2>
Then, add a link to the bookmark ("Jump to Chapter 4"), from within the same page: <a href="#C4">Jump to Chapter 4</a>
Or, add a link to the bookmark ("Jump to Chapter 4"), from another page: <a href="html_demo.html#C4">Jump to Chapter 4</a>

The <img> tag is empty, it contains attributes only, and does not have a closing tag.
The alt attribute is required. A web page will not validate correctly without it.
Always specify the width and height of an image. If width and height are not specified, the page might flicker while the image loads.

A screen reader is a software program that reads the HTML code, converts the text, and allows the user to 
"listen" to the content. Screen readers are useful for people who are visually impaired or learning disabled.

A URL is another word for a web address.A URL can be composed of words (w3schools.com),
or an Internet Protocol (IP) address (192.68.20.50).
A web address like https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp follows these syntax rules:
scheme://prefix.domain:port/path/filename
scheme - defines the type of Internet service (most common is http or https)
prefix - defines a domain prefix (default for http is www)
domain - defines the Internet domain name (like w3schools.com)
port - defines the port number at the host (default for http is 80)
path - defines a path at the server (If omitted: the root directory of the site)
filename - defines the name of a document or resource

common url scheme: http/https/ftp(Downloading or uploading files)/file(A file on your computer)
