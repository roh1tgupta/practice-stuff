Data Models

Users Table (Relational DB, e.g., PostgreSQL, sharded by user_id):

user_id (primary key, auto-increment or UUID)
username, email, password_hash, profile_info
follower_count, following_count (for quick stats)


Follows Table (Relational DB, sharded by follower_id or followed_id):

follower_id (foreign key to users)
followed_id (foreign key to users)
timestamp (for ordering)


Posts Table (NoSQL like Cassandra, sharded by post_id or user_id):

post_id (primary key, UUID or snowflake ID for uniqueness)
user_id (author)
content (text, media URLs)
timestamp
like_count, reply_count, retweet_count (denormalized for fast reads)


Timelines/Feeds (NoSQL, e.g., Redis sorted sets or Cassandra time-series tables, sharded by user_id):

user_id (key)
list of post_ids with timestamps (for quick retrieval)


Notifications Table (NoSQL, sharded by user_id):

user_id (recipient)
notification_id
type (like, reply, mention, follow)
from_user_id, post_id, timestamp



Posting a Post

API Endpoint: User sends a POST request to /api/posts with content.

Authenticate user (e.g., JWT token).
Validate input (length, spam detection).


Storage:

Generate post_id.
Insert into Posts table.
Update user's post_count (async if needed).


Fan-out on Write (for efficient feed generation):

Fetch the list of followers (from Follows table, cached in Redis for popular users).
For each follower, push the post_id to their timeline (e.g., append to a Redis list or Cassandra row).
Limit fan-out: For celebrities with millions of followers, use a hybrid approach (fan-out to active followers only, fall back to fan-in on read for others) to avoid write amplification.
Asynchronous: Use a message queue (Kafka) to offload fan-out to worker nodes, preventing API slowdown.


Notifications: If the post mentions users (@username), enqueue notifications for them.

This ensures writes are distributed but can handle high traffic via queuing.
Following Users

API Endpoint: POST /api/follow with followed_id.

Insert into Follows table.
Increment counts on both users (atomic transaction or eventual consistency).


Backfill Feed: Optionally, fan-out recent posts from the followed user to the follower's timeline (limited to last 100 posts to avoid overload).
Unfollow: Reverse the above, remove posts from timeline if needed (but often skipped for simplicity, as timelines are time-bound).

Feed Generation
The home feed shows posts from followed users, sorted by timestamp.

API Endpoint: GET /api/feed?limit=50&cursor=last_timestamp.

Authenticate and get user_id.


Hybrid Fan-out/Fan-in:

Fan-out on Write (Push Model): Pre-build timelines by pushing posts to followers' inboxes during posting. Ideal for most users (low follower count).

Pros: Fast reads (just fetch from user's timeline cache).
Cons: High write cost for influencers.


Fan-in on Read (Pull Model): For users with many followers or during catch-up, query posts from followed users and merge them on-the-fly.

Use a query like: SELECT posts FROM followed_users WHERE timestamp > last_seen, sorted by time.
Pros: Reduces write amplification.
Cons: Slower reads under high load.


Hybrid: Fan-out for users with <10k followers; fan-in for others. Use Redis for merging sorted sets.


Pagination: Use cursor-based (timestamp or post_id) to fetch next batch.
Algorithmic Enhancements (Optional): Rank by engagement (likes/replies) using ML models, but start with chronological.
Caching:

Cache timelines in Redis (TTL: 1-5 minutes for freshness).
Invalidate on new posts or follows.
Multi-level: Edge caches (CDN) for static media, app-level for feeds.



Notifications

Generation:

Triggered by events (post, like, reply, follow).
Use event-driven architecture: Publish events to Kafka topics (e.g., "likes", "mentions").
Workers consume events, insert into Notifications table, and push to real-time channels.


Delivery:

Push Notifications: Use Firebase/APNs for mobile alerts.
In-App: WebSocket (e.g., via Socket.io) for real-time updates.
Email/SMS: For critical ones, async via queues.


Storage and Fetch: User's notifications as a time-sorted list in Redis/Cassandra.

API: GET /api/notifications?limit=20.


Scaling: Deduplicate (e.g., group similar notifications), rate-limit to prevent spam.

Scaling Components

Sharding:

By user_id: Hash user_id to assign to database shards (e.g., consistent hashing in Cassandra).
Cross-shard queries: For fan-in, use scatter-gather pattern (query multiple shards in parallel).
Horizontal scaling: Add shards as users grow.


Caching:

Redis clusters for timelines, user profiles, follows lists.
Write-through for consistency: Update cache during writes.
Eviction: LRU for least-used data.


Load Balancing: Nginx/Envoy for API gateways, auto-scaling groups for services.
Monitoring: Prometheus for metrics (latency, throughput), ELK stack for logs.

Challenges and Solutions

High Read/Write Traffic:

Reads >> Writes: Optimize reads with caching and fan-out on write.
Spikes (e.g., viral events): Use auto-scaling, rate-limiting, and CDNs for media.
Throughput: Aim for <100ms latency; benchmark with tools like Apache JMeter.


Timeline Consistency:

Eventual Consistency: Acceptable for social feeds (e.g., a post might appear delayed).
Strong Consistency: For critical ops (e.g., follows), use distributed transactions (e.g., via Spanner) or 2PC, but avoid for performance.
Out-of-Order: Handle with client-side sorting or server-side merging.
Data Loss: Replicate databases (e.g., 3x replicas), use WAL for recovery.


Other Challenges:

Privacy: Access controls on posts (public/private).
Spam/Abuse: ML filters, CAPTCHAs.
Global Distribution: Geo-replication for low latency.
Cost: Optimize storage (compress media, archive old posts).



This design provides a robust foundation, iterable to add features like search, ads, or recommendations. For production, iterate based on metrics and user feedback






---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




The system handles millions of users with high read/write traffic (e.g., 1000s of posts/sec), using microservices, PostgreSQL (relational for Users/Follows), Cassandra (NoSQL for Posts/Comments/Notifications), Redis (caching), Kafka/Redis Pub/Sub (events), and hybrid fan-out/fan-in for feeds. Key challenges: High traffic (solved by sharding/caching), consistency (eventual via Pub/Sub), and scaling (auto-scaling workers).
1. Overall Design and Flow
Key Aspects:

Posting: Users create posts/comments via REST API (e.g., POST /api/posts). Auth via JWT. Validate, store in DB, fan-out to timelines, notify mentions.
Following: Directional follows (POST /api/follow). Updates Follows DB, backfills timelines, increments stats.
Feed Generation: Hybrid: Fan-out on write (push posts to followers' timelines during posting for most users); fan-in on read (merge followed users' posts on-the-fly for celebrities). Chronological or ranked (ML optional). Paginated via cursors (timestamp/post_id).
Notifications: Event-driven (likes, replies, mentions, follows). Stored in DB, cached in Redis, delivered real-time (WebSocket) or push (Firebase/APNs).

High-Level Flow:

User Action: Frontend sends REST API (e.g., POST /api/posts content="Hello!").
Backend Processing: Authenticate, validate, write to DB (write-through to cache).
Event Propagation: Publish to Pub/Sub (Kafka/Redis) for async tasks (e.g., fan-out, notifications).
Workers/Services: Consume events, update caches/timelines, send notifications.
Read/Response: Frontend fetches via API (hits cache/DB), receives real-time via WebSocket.
Scaling: Sharding (by user_id/post_id), caching (Redis TTL/LRU), queues (Kafka for spikes).

Components:

Fan-Out on Write/Read: Write: Push to followers' timelines (efficient for <10k followers). Read: Pull/merge for others.
Caching: Multi-level (L1 frontend localStorage, L2 Redis). Patterns: Cache-aside (lazy read), write-through (sync write), Pub/Sub invalidation.
Sharding: Consistent hashing (Cassandra/PostgreSQL).
Challenges: Traffic spikes (rate-limiting, CDNs), consistency (eventual, TTLs), privacy (access controls).

Services: API gateway (Nginx), auth service, feed service (fan-in/out), notification service (workers), background jobs (cron/Celery for pre-warming).
2. Each Table: Population, Consumption, Services, and Caches
Users Table (PostgreSQL, sharded by user_id; fields: user_id, username, email, password_hash, profile_info, follower_count, following_count).

Populated: Writes via API handlers (signup: POST /api/users → insert row, init stats). Updates: Profile edit (PUT /api/users/{user_id} → update profile_info), follow (increment counts).
Consumed: Reads by auth service (login: POST /api/login → verify password_hash), profile service (GET /api/users/{user_id} → fetch profile_info), feed service (for post attribution). Services: Auth, profile, search.
Caches (Redis, 4 types/6 patterns):

user:profile:{user_id} (hash, TTL 10-30 min): Cache-aside on view, write-through on edit.

user:stats:{user_id}:followers/following/posts (counters, no TTL): Write-through on follow/post.
search:users:{query} (set, TTL 5 min): Cache-aside on search.


Services/Caches Interaction: API handlers update DB/cache; Pub/Sub (user_updates) invalidates on changes; background jobs pre-warm profiles.

Follows Table (PostgreSQL, sharded by follower_id; fields: follower_id, followed_id, timestamp).

Populated: Writes via follow service (POST /api/follow → insert row, update Users stats). Unfollow: DELETE row.

Caches (Redis, 2 types/2 patterns):

user:followers:{user_id} (sorted set, TTL 5-15 min): Cache-aside on view, write-through on follow (ZADD).
user:following:{user_id} (sorted set, TTL 5-15 min): Cache-aside on view, write-through on follow (ZADD).


Services/Caches Interaction: Follow service updates DB/cache; Pub/Sub (follow_updates) propagates to timelines/stats; jobs pre-warm popular lists.

Posts Table (Cassandra, sharded by post_id; fields: post_id, user_id, content, timestamp, like_count, reply_count, retweet_count).

Populated: Writes via post service (POST /api/posts → insert row, init counts). Interactions: POST /api/posts/{post_id}/like → increment like_count.

post:engagement:{post_id}:likes/replies/retweets (counters, no TTL): Write-through on interactions (INCR).


Services/Caches Interaction: Post service updates DB/cache; Pub/Sub (post_updates) fans out to timelines; jobs pre-warm viral posts.
Comments Extension (Separate Comments table in Cassandra, sharded by post_id; fields: comment_id, post_id, user_id, content, parent_comment_id, like_count).

Populated: POST /api/posts/{post_id}/comments → insert row, increment Posts reply_count.
Consumed: Thread service (GET /api/posts/{post_id}/comments → fetch by post_id).
Caches (4 types/4 patterns): post:engagement:{post_id}:replies (counter), comment:meta:{comment_id} (hash, TTL 1-5 min), post:comments:{post_id}/{parent_id} (sorted set, TTL 1-5 min), comment:engagement:{comment_id}:likes (counter).
Services/Caches: Comment service updates DB/cache; Pub/Sub (comment_updates) for threads/notifications.



Timelines/Feeds (No DB table; derived, cached in Redis sorted sets).

Populated: Fan-out: POST /api/posts → push post_id to followers' timelines. Backfill: POST /api/follow → add recent posts.
Consumed: Feed service (GET /api/feed → fetch post_ids, then post metadata). Services: Feed, post.
Caches (Redis, 1 primary type/2 patterns):

user:timeline:{user_id} (sorted set, TTL 1-5 min): Fan-out on post (ZADD), cache-aside on read (ZRANGE).
user:posts:{user_id} (sorted set, TTL 5 min, optional): Write-through on post.


Services/Caches Interaction: Feed service merges (fan-in fallback); Pub/Sub (post_updates) triggers ZADD/ZREM; jobs pre-warm active users.

Notifications Table (Cassandra, sharded by user_id; fields: user_id, notification_id, type, from_user_id, post_id/comment_id, timestamp, content).

Populated: Event-driven: Like/follow → insert row, increment counts.
Consumed: Notification service (GET /api/notifications → fetch by user_id). Services: Notification, engagement.
Caches (Redis, 1 type/1 pattern):

user:notifications:{user_id} (list, TTL 1 hr): Write-through on event (LPUSH), cache-aside on read (LRANGE).


Services/Caches Interaction: Event services publish to Pub/Sub (notification_updates); workers consume for LPUSH/WebSocket/Firebase; jobs trim old entries.

Note on Redis Commands (ZADD, ZREM, ZRANGE)
Redis sorted sets are used for ordered lists (e.g., timelines, follow lists) with members (e.g., post_id) and scores (e.g., timestamp for chronology).

ZADD: Adds/updates members with scores (e.g., ZADD user:timeline:12345 1700000001 abc123 adds post_id to timeline). O(log N), used for fan-out (new posts/follows).
ZREM: Removes members (e.g., ZREM user:timeline:12345 abc123 on deletion). O(log N), for cleanup (unfollow/delete).
ZRANGE: Retrieves range of members by score (e.g., ZRANGE user:timeline:12345 0 49 REV for recent 50 posts). O(log N + M), for feed/profile pagination (REV for descending order).
Other commands: LPUSH/LRANGE (lists for notifications, FIFO), HSET/HGETALL (hashes for metadata), INCR/DECR (counters for stats/engagement).

Real Examples of Key Flows
Here’s one real example per major flow, mirroring the like example structure.
