E-commerce Platform Design
Overview
This document outlines the design of a scalable e-commerce platform similar to Amazon, focusing on key aspects like product catalog, search, cart, payments, and recommendations. The architecture leverages microservices for modularity, Elasticsearch for search, Redis for caching, and a CDN for content delivery. It addresses challenges such as high availability, inventory consistency, and search scalability. The system is cloud-native, using containers (Docker) and orchestration (Kubernetes), with AWS/GCP/Azure as the cloud provider. Data storage combines relational (PostgreSQL) and NoSQL (DynamoDB) databases. Security includes HTTPS, OAuth, and PCI compliance.
Key Aspects
1. Product Catalog
Manages product listings with details like descriptions, images, prices, and attributes.

Architecture: Catalog Service microservice with NoSQL database (DynamoDB) for flexible schemas. Elasticsearch indexes product data for fast querying.
Features:
Hierarchical categories (e.g., Electronics > Phones).
Seller uploads via API with moderation.
CDN for fast image/video delivery.


Data Flow: Product updates trigger events (Kafka) to sync search index and recommendations.

2. Search
Enables users to find products via keywords, filters, and facets.

Architecture: Search Service microservice with Elasticsearch as the engine.
Features:
Full-text search with relevance scoring (BM25).
Faceted navigation (price, brand filters).
Autocomplete and spell-check via Elasticsearch suggesters.
Personalized results based on user history.


Integration: Cache queries in Redis; use CDN for static assets.

3. Cart
Tracks items for purchase, persistent across sessions.

Architecture: Cart Service with Redis for session data or DynamoDB for persistence.
Features:
Add/remove items, update quantities.
Session-based for guests; user-linked for logged-in users.
Real-time stock validation via Inventory Service.


Data Flow: Events update recommendations; cache cart state.

4. Payments
Handles checkout, payment processing, and order confirmation.

Architecture: Payments Service with gateways (Stripe, PayPal). Relational DB (PostgreSQL) for order history.
Features:
Multiple payment methods (cards, wallets, BNPL).
Fraud detection via ML models.
Post-payment: Generate invoices, update inventory.


Security: Tokenize data, PCI-DSS compliance. Async processing via message queues.

5. Recommendations
Provides personalized product suggestions.

Architecture: Recommendations Service with ML models (collaborative filtering, TensorFlow). Data from user behavior in a data lake (S3).
Features:
Real-time (session-based) and batch recommendations.
Types: Similar products, personalized feeds.


Integration: Elasticsearch for similar items; cache in Redis.

System Components

Component
Purpose
Implementation Details

Microservices
Modularize functionality.
Services: Catalog, Search, Cart, Payments, Recommendations. API Gateway (Kong) for routing; gRPC/REST for communication. Circuit breakers (Hystrix).


Elasticsearch
Search and indexing.
Clustered with sharding. Custom analyzers for multilingual support. Logstash for data ingestion.


Caching
Reduce latency.
Redis for sessions, carts, queries. Multi-level caching: L1 (in-memory), L2 (Redis).


CDN
Accelerate content delivery.
Cache static assets (S3). Webhooks for invalidations.




Addressing Challenges
1. High Availability

Problem: Downtime during peak traffic (e.g., Black Friday).
Solutions:
Multi-AZ deployment with auto-scaling.
Load balancers (ELB) with health checks.
Blue-green deployments for zero downtime.
Monitoring: Prometheus/Grafana; failover to read replicas.
Goal: 99.99% uptime.



2. Inventory Consistency

Problem: Prevent overselling in distributed systems.
Solutions:
Optimistic locking or Saga pattern for updates.
Inventory Service with event sourcing (Kafka).
Reserve stock in cart, release on timeout.
Compensating transactions for conflicts.



3. Search Scalability

Problem: Handle billions of products/queries.
Solutions:
Elasticsearch clustering with horizontal scaling.
Index partitioning by category/region.
Query optimization: Aggregation pipelines, Redis caching.
Background jobs for reindexing.
Monitor with Kibana; scale for 10x traffic spikes.

Saga Pattern Implementation
Overview
The Saga pattern ensures inventory consistency by breaking complex transactions into local, service-specific transactions with compensating actions for rollbacks. It uses choreography (event-driven, decentralized) for scalability, with Kafka as the message broker. The Saga handles order placement: validate cart, reserve inventory, process payment, confirm order.
Key Concepts

Local Transactions: Atomic operations per service (e.g., deduct stock).
Compensating Transactions: Reverse actions (e.g., restock on failure).
Eventual Consistency: Consistent state over time.
Failure Handling: Retries, timeouts, idempotency.

Saga Workflow
For an order placement:



Step
Service
Local Transaction
Compensating Transaction
Success Event
Failure Event



1
Cart Service
Validate cart, initiate saga.
N/A
OrderInitiated
OrderFailed


2
Inventory Service
Reserve stock.
Release stock.
InventoryReserved
InventoryReservationFailed


3
Payments Service
Charge payment.
Refund payment.
PaymentProcessed
PaymentFailed


4
Order Service
Create order, notify user.
Cancel order.
OrderConfirmed
OrderConfirmationFailed


5
Shipping Service
Schedule shipment.
Cancel shipment.
ShipmentScheduled
ShipmentFailed


Implementation Steps
1. Infrastructure

Kafka: Topic saga-events for events with saga ID (UUID) and payload.
Databases: PostgreSQL (Orders), DynamoDB (Inventory). Saga state in Redis or Eventuate/Axon.
Libraries:
Java: Spring Cloud Stream (Kafka).
Node.js: KafkaJS or NestJS Microservices.
Go: Watermill or Sarama.


Monitoring: Zipkin for tracing, Prometheus for metrics.

2. Event Handlers
Services subscribe to events and publish outcomes. Example pseudocode (Python):
import uuid
from kafka import KafkaProducer, KafkaConsumer

# Event Bus
producer = KafkaProducer(bootstrap_servers='localhost:9092')

def publish_event(topic, event_data):
    producer.send(topic, value=event_data)

# Inventory Service
class InventoryService:
    def __init__(self):
        self.consumer = KafkaConsumer('saga-events', bootstrap_servers='localhost:9092')
        self.inventory_db = {}  # Simulated DB

    def handle_order_initiated(self, event):
        saga_id = event['saga_id']
        order_items = event['items']
        try:
            for item in order_items:
                if self.inventory_db.get(item
