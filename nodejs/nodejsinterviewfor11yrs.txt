How would you design a scalable Node.js application to handle millions of requests per second, including considerations for load balancing, clustering, and caching?

Explain the Node.js event loop in detail. How would you debug and optimize performance bottlenecks caused by blocking operations in the event loop?

Design a Node.js microservices architecture for a real-time chat application. Discuss communication protocols, service discovery, and fault tolerance.

How do you handle memory leaks in a Node.js application? Describe tools and techniques you’ve used to identify and resolve them in production.

What are the trade-offs of using Node.js streams for processing large datasets versus in-memory processing? Provide a scenario where streams are critical.

How would you implement a custom Node.js module with both synchronous and asynchronous APIs, ensuring backward compatibility and deprecation warnings?

Explain how you’d secure a Node.js REST API, covering authentication (e.g., JWT, OAuth), rate limiting, input validation, and protection against common vulnerabilities like SQL injection or XSS.

Describe how you’d optimize a Node.js application for CPU-intensive tasks. When would you offload tasks to worker threads or external services, and how would you implement it?

How do you handle database connection pooling in a Node.js application with thousands of concurrent users? Compare approaches using libraries like pg or mongoose.

Design a fault-tolerant file upload system in Node.js that handles large files (e.g., 10GB) with progress tracking, resumable uploads, and error recovery.

What strategies would you use to monitor and profile a Node.js application in production? Discuss tools like PM2, New Relic, or custom metrics with Prometheus.

How would you implement a WebSocket-based real-time feature in Node.js (e.g., live notifications)? Discuss scaling with Redis or message queues and handling connection drops.

Explain the differences between Node.js’s child_process module and Worker Threads. When would you choose one over the other for parallel processing?

How do you handle versioning and backward compatibility in a Node.js API? Provide an example of handling breaking changes in a production environment.

Design a logging system for a Node.js application that supports distributed tracing across microservices, with considerations for performance and log aggregation.

What are the implications of running Node.js in a containerized environment (e.g., Docker)? Discuss challenges like signal handling, memory limits, and orchestration with Kubernetes.

How would you implement a rate limiter in Node.js for an API, including considerations for distributed systems where multiple instances are running?

Explain how you’d use Node.js’s stream.pipeline to process a large dataset with multiple transformations, ensuring robust error handling and backpressure management.

How do you optimize Node.js for low-latency responses in a high-throughput API? Discuss techniques like connection pooling, caching, and async/await patterns.

What are the best practices for writing unit and integration tests for a Node.js application? Compare testing frameworks (e.g., Mocha, Jest) and discuss mocking strategies.
