//blown garland


Nothing is eternal in the world, Kostya understood it on the 7-th of January
when he saw partially dead four-color garland.

Now he has a goal to replace dead light bulbs, however he doesn't know how many
light bulbs for each color are required. It is guaranteed that for each of four colors
at least one light is working.
It is known that the garland contains light bulbs of four colors: red, blue, yellow and green.
The garland is made as follows: if you take any four consecutive light bulbs then there will
not be light bulbs with the same color among them. For example, the garland can look
like "RYBGRYBGRY", "YBGRYBGRYBG", "BGRYB", but can not look like "BGRYG", "YBGRYBYGR" or "BGYBGY".
Letters denote colors: 'R'  red, 'B'  blue, 'Y'  yellow, 'G'  green.
Using the information that for each color at least one light bulb still works count the number
of dead light bulbs of each four colors.

Input Format
The first and the only line contains the string s, which describes the garland,
the i-th symbol of which describes the color of the i-th light bulb in the order from the
beginning of garland:
'R'  the light bulb is red,
'B'  the light bulb is blue,
'Y'  the light bulb is yellow,
'G'  the light bulb is green,
'!'  the light bulb is dead.

Constraints
4 < = |s| < = 100

Output Format
