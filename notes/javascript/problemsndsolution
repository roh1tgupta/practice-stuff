Do you know that when you deploy your React application

which is created using 𝗰𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘁𝗲-𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗰𝘁-𝗮𝗽𝗽 or your own webpack configuration to a live website like Netlify, Vercel, Heroku etc,

your entire source code is visible to everyone from the sources tab of the developer toolbar as shown in the screenshot of this post.

This is not an issue with the 𝗰𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘁𝗲-𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗰𝘁-𝗮𝗽𝗽 but All of the source code is added because of the source map

which helps to easily identify the source of the bug that will occur on the live site in the future.

This is fine If the website source code is publicly available on GitHub.

But you definitely don't want everyone to see your entire source code If it's a private repository or you're working on a client project.

There is an easy way to fix it.

Create a file with the name .env in your project folder with the below code inside it

GENERATE_SOURCEMAP=false

so when you run 𝗻𝗽𝗺 𝗿𝘂𝗻 𝗯𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱 or 𝘆𝗮𝗿𝗻 𝗿𝘂𝗻 𝗯𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱 command from the terminal.

It will generate a 𝗯𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱 folder with minified files without a source map that you can deploy to the production.

when histting pdf url from iframe, getting contect security issue.
solution, add content-security header from BE response with value of host of that iframe like below:
res.setHeader("X-Content-Security-Policy", "https://marketplace.carrefouruae.com");
    res.setHeader("Content-Security-Policy", "https://marketplace.carrefouruae.com/seller");


explicitly setting cookiew value with httpOnly false, here if httpOnly is set to true then this can't be read from code on client side, this si used to pass only in api calls
COOKIES.set('page_type', pageName, { path: '/', httpOnly: false });
