React follows the observable pattern and listens for state changes. When the state of a component changes,
React updates the virtual DOM tree. Once the virtual DOM has been updated, React then compares the current
version of the virtual DOM with the previous version of the virtual DOM. This process is called “diffing”.
Once React knows which virtual DOM objects have changed, then React updates only those objects, in the real DOM.
This makes the performance far better when compared to manipulating the real DOM directly.
This makes React standout as a high performance JavaScript library.

Batch Update
React follows a batch update mechanism to update the real DOM.
Hence, leading to increased performance. This means that updates to the real DOM are sent in batches,
instead of sending updates for every single change in state.
The repainting of the UI is the most expensive part, and React efficiently ensures that the real 
DOM receives only batched updates to repaint the UI.
