React follows the observable pattern and listens for state changes. When the state of a component changes,
React updates the virtual DOM tree. Once the virtual DOM has been updated, React then compares the current
version of the virtual DOM with the previous version of the virtual DOM. This process is called “diffing”.
Once React knows which virtual DOM objects have changed, then React updates only those objects, in the real DOM.
This makes the performance far better when compared to manipulating the real DOM directly.
This makes React standout as a high performance JavaScript library.

Batch Update
React follows a batch update mechanism to update the real DOM.
Hence, leading to increased performance. This means that updates to the real DOM are sent in batches,
instead of sending updates for every single change in state.
The repainting of the UI is the most expensive part, and React efficiently ensures that the real 
DOM receives only batched updates to repaint the UI.






CORS : Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a mechanism that uses additional HTTP headers to tell a browser to let a web application running at one origin (domain) have permission to access selected resources from a server at a different origin. A web application makes a cross-origin HTTP request when it requests a resource that has a different origin (domain, protocol, and port) than its own origin.


when in any file global variable is used directly, linter shows error, to remove this either use it as window.(name_of_variable) or define that on top of file as /* global name_of_variable */

React.js: Set innerHTML vs dangerouslySetInnerHTML
var test = React.createClass({
  render: function(){
    return (
      <div contentEditable='true' dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: "Hello" }}></div>
    );
  }
});
vs
var test = React.createClass({
  componentDidUpdate: function(prevProp, prevState){
    this.refs.test.innerHTML = "Hello";
  },
  render: function(){
    return (
      <div contentEditable='true' ref='test'></div>
    );
  }
});

The immediate effect of using innerHTML versus dangerouslySetInnerHTML is identical -- the DOM node will update with the injected HTML.

However, behind the scenes when you use dangerouslySetInnerHTML it lets React know that the HTML inside of that component is not something it cares about.

Because React uses a virtual DOM, when it goes to compare the diff against the actual DOM, it can straight up bypass checking the children of that node because it knows the HTML is coming from another source. So there's performance gains.

More importantly, if you simply use innerHTML, React has no way to know the DOM node has been modified. The next time the render function is called, React will overwrite the content that was manually injected with what it thinks the correct state of that DOM node should be.

Your solution to use componentDidUpdate to always ensure the content is in sync I believe would work but there might be a flash during each render.

Since innerHTML is a native method that binds the SVG code directly to the DOM without considering anything. On the other hand, dangerouslySetInnerHTML is the method come from React that the SVG code has to be parsed as React Component children in prior to put them to virtual DOM and then render to the DOM

A negative value (usually tabindex="-1") means that the element should be focusable, but should not be reachable via sequential keyboard navigation. It's mostly useful to create accessible widgets with JavaScript
