# Query Complexity Analysis in GraphQL

## Overview

Query Complexity Analysis is a critical security feature that protects GraphQL servers from computationally expensive queries that could overwhelm server resources. This implementation provides intelligent analysis of query complexity and rejects queries exceeding a complexity score of 1000.

## What is Query Complexity?

GraphQL's flexibility allows clients to request exactly the data they need, but this can also lead to queries that are computationally expensive. Query complexity analysis assigns a "cost" to each field in a query and calculates a total complexity score to prevent resource exhaustion.

### Why Query Complexity Analysis Matters

Without complexity analysis, malicious or poorly designed queries can:
- Consume excessive CPU resources
- Overwhelm database connections
- Cause memory exhaustion
- Lead to denial of service (DoS)
- Impact performance for other users

### Example of High-Complexity Query

```graphql
query ExpensiveQuery {
  # Each books query has high complexity (15 points)
  books {
    id
    name
    # Each author relationship adds complexity (5 points)
    author {
      id
      name
      # Nested books query multiplies complexity (15 × 1.5 = 22.5 points)
      books {
        id
        name
        # Reviews add more complexity (8 points each)
        reviews {
          id
          rating
          comment
          # User relationship adds more (3 points each)
          user {
            id
            username
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
  
  # Statistics queries are expensive (50 points each)
  authorStats1: authorStatistics(id: "1") {
    totalBooks
    averageBookRating
    mostPopularGenre
  }
  
  authorStats2: authorStatistics(id: "2") {
    totalBooks
    averageBookRating
    mostPopularGenre
  }
  
  # Admin stats are very expensive (75 points)
  adminStats {
    totalUsers
    totalBooks
    totalAuthors
    totalReviews
    usersByRole {
      role
      count
    }
  }
}
```

**Complexity Calculation**: This query could easily exceed 1000 points and would be rejected.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Complexity Scoring System

#### Field Complexity Weights

Our system assigns complexity scores based on the computational cost of each field:

**Basic Fields (1 point each):**
- `id`, `name`, `title`, `email`, `username`, `role`
- `genre`, `country`, `age`, `rating`, `comment`, `createdAt`

**Relationship Fields (3-10 points):**
- `author`: 5 points
- `user`: 3 points
- `book`: 3 points
- `books`: 10 points
- `reviews`: 8 points

**List Queries (12-30 points):**
- `authors`: 15 points
- `users`: 12 points
- `booksByGenre`: 20 points
- `searchBooks`: 30 points
- `filteredBooks`: 25 points

**Statistics & Aggregations (50-75 points):**
- `authorStatistics`: 50 points
- `adminStats`: 75 points

**Mutations (5-25 points):**
- Simple mutations (add/update/delete): 5-15 points
- Batch operations: 25 points
- Authentication operations: 20-25 points

#### Complexity Multipliers

The system applies multipliers based on query characteristics:

- **List Fields**: 2× multiplier
- **Nested Fields**: 1.5× multiplier per nesting level beyond depth 2
- **Arguments**: 1.2× multiplier when field has arguments
- **Aliases**: 1.1× multiplier for aliased fields
- **Pagination**: Additional multiplier based on limit value

#### Penalties

Additional complexity penalties are applied for:
- **Field Repetition**: +10 points per excessive repetition (>3 times)
- **Excessive Depth**: +20 points per depth level beyond 5

### 2. Configuration Options

```javascript
const complexityConfig = {
  maxComplexity: 1000,          // Maximum allowed complexity score
  enabled: true,                // Enable/disable complexity analysis
  fieldComplexities: {          // Custom field complexity weights
    customExpensiveField: 100
  },
  multipliers: {
    list: 2,                    // List field multiplier
    nested: 1.5,                // Nesting multiplier
    argument: 1.2,              // Argument multiplier
    alias: 1.1                  // Alias multiplier
  },
  messages: {                   // Custom error messages
    complexityExceeded: (score, max) => 
      `Query too complex (${score}). Max: ${max}`
  }
};
```

## Usage Examples

### 1. Simple Query (Low Complexity: ~20 points)

```graphql
query SimpleQuery {
  books {           # 10 points (list) × 2 (list multiplier) = 20 points
    id              # 1 point
    name            # 1 point
  }
}
```

**Total Complexity**: ~22 points ✅ **Allowed**

### 2. Moderate Query (Medium Complexity: ~150 points)

```graphql
query ModerateQuery {
  books {                    # 10 × 2 = 20 points
    id                       # 1 point
    name                     # 1 point
    genre                    # 1 point
    author {                 # 5 × 1.5 (nested) = 7.5 points

      name                   # 1 point
      country                # 1 point
    }
    reviews {                # 8 × 2 (list) × 1.5 (nested) = 24 points
      id                     # 1 point
      rating                 # 1 point
      comment                # 1 point
    }
  }
  
  authors {                  # 15 × 2 = 30 points
    id                       # 1 point
    name                     # 1 point
  }
}
```

**Total Complexity**: ~150 points ✅ **Allowed**

### 3. Complex Query (High Complexity: ~400 points)

  stats3: authorStatistics(id: "3") { ... }   # 50 points
  stats4: authorStatistics(id: "4") { ... }   # 50 points
  stats5: authorStatistics(id: "5") { ... }   # 50 points
  
  # Multiple admin stats

  # Large pagination
  hugePagination: paginatedBooks(
    pagination: { limit: 1000 }               # 20 × 2 × 100 = 4000 points
  ) {
    books {
      id
      name
      author {
        books {
          reviews {
            user {
              reviews { ... }                  # Deep nesting adds more
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Total Complexity**: >5000 points ❌ **Rejected**

## Error Responses

When a query exceeds the complexity limit, the server returns a detailed error:

```json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "Query rejected: Complexity score too high (1250). Maximum allowed: 1000",
      "extensions": {
        "code": "QUERY_COMPLEXITY_TOO_HIGH",
        "complexity": 1250,
        "maxAllowed": 1000,
        "baseComplexity": 1180,
        "penalties": 70,
        "analysis": {
          "fieldCount": 45,
          "maxDepth": 6,
          "mostExpensiveFields": [
            {
              "field": "adminStats",
              "finalComplexity": 75,
              "depth": 1
            },
            {
              "field": "authorStatistics",
              "finalComplexity": 50,
              "depth": 1
            }
          ],
          "fieldBreakdown": [
            {
              "field": "books",
              "baseComplexity": 10,
              "multiplier": "2.00",
              "finalComplexity": 20,
              "depth": 1,
              "hasArguments": false
            }
